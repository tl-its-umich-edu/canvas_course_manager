    There are two different versions of the Canvas Course Manager:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>This version, which is used by Service Center staff only (to use it you must be a member of its-canvas-sections@umich.edu -- <a href="https://mcommunity.umich.edu/#group/members:its-canvas-sections"> contact an owner to be added)</a>.</li>
    <li>A separate version for instructors.  To access:  In Canvas, all courses have a U-M Course Manager tab in the left hand navigation visible to instructors and admins only .  Only instructors and admins can see this tab (not students).</li>
  </ol>
<p>
    Note that you should not have the U-M Course Manager open in a Canvas course while using the Service Center version -- you can get unexpected errors.  If you have had the U-M Course Manager open in a course and you get "Access Denied" upon opening the Service Center version reloading the page will clear the error.
</p>
<p>
  Both versions allow users to:
</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Combine sections, rename courses after sections are altered (Service Center only), and uncrosslist sections (included below)</li>
    <li>Add friend accounts to courses</li>
  </ol>



  <p>
    Now that faculty can add friends/combine sections themselves why might they ask the Service Center to continue to do so?
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Instructor preference.</li>
    <li>The instructor might not be the instructor of record for all the sections s/he wants to combine.  The instructor version ONLY allows instructors to combine sections if their department has assigned the class to them in M-Pathways.  The Service Center version is more flexible.</li>
  </ol>
